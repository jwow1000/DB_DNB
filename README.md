## api calls

how I grabbed releases from a label:

https://api.discogs.com/labels/128/releases?page=3&per_page=20&sort=year&sort_order=asc

\*\* some releases on metalheadz(128) dont have a year so I skipped forward a couple pages(3). 1992 - 98 was when metalheadz was good so the earlier the better hence sort_order ascending. and we only want 20 while we figure out this data structure m8.
